# Microbloggr

## Introduction

This is a simple Ruby on Rails app developed by Graham Hutchinson. 
It is intended to represent the ability to develop a fully functional, full stack application, 
developing the front-end and back-end. This app contains models, controllers, views, mailers, 
the ability for users to signup/login/logout, password confirmation/reset, a full testing suite, 
a micro-posting system similar to twitter, a custom domain complete with autogenerated data to populate the app.
This app has been deployed to production using Heroku, and can be viewed
[here](https://microbloggr.herokuapp.com/).

## Getting started

If you'd like to run this app locally, first clone this repo and
